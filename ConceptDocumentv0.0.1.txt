earns money through street racing to buy parts and cars, and repeats until they can face off against the
fastest racer in the city.

=== Game Sales ===
Consumer Group: Fans of SR1/SR2, Muscle car fans, and racing game/sim fans.

Estimated price: TBD

=== Game Atmosphere ===
TBD



=== Game Play ===
Executing Game Application: Do we want a menu to pick resolution and rendering device before launching?
Do we want any kinds of splash screens or intro videos?
Game Options: Obviously there should be video, audio (subtitle?), and control options, but what gameplay-affecting
options should be available? What options should there be for the HUD? Do we want a cheat menu at all?
Story Synopsis: There's a story?
Modes: There should be at least two, "Single Race" and "Career". Single Race should allow you to pick and
customize a car, and Career should be self-explanatory. Multiplayer should be a mode when singleplayer stuff
is completed.
Game Elements: Not sure what to put here.
Game Levels: Various tracks in multiple cities, plus a garage in each city.
Player's Controls: Keyboard, mouse?, game controller(s).
Winning: Beat the fastest racer in the country, presumably.
Losing: Put yourself in a position where you can't race. Run out of money, lose your last car while unable to afford
another, or damage your last car while unable to afford parts to put it back in running order.
End: Either a bathroom wall high score list, or a cutscene showing what happens when you win. Either way, you'll
be returned to the main menu.
Why Is This All Fun?: Tuning cars is fun, racing cars is fun, and then there's the complicating factor that you'll
have to wager for every last cent of money you can earn.

=== Key Features ===
Number of Levels: TBD
Number of Characters: TBD, but don't forget the fastest racer in the country.
Time of Game Play: TBD
Replayability: Should be moderately high, just by virtue of having lots of valid approaches to racing and picking
opponents/challenges.
Audio Specifications: TBD

=== Selling Features ===
Marketing Ideas: "It's Street Rod 3, at long last! The heir to the throne! All of the stuff you liked about the
earlier games, but modernized and expanded!"

aren't many games about muscle cars specifically today.
Merchandising: Keychains? Shirts? Hats?
Consumer Group: Aside from us? Fans of the series, fans of muscle cars, and fans of racing games/sims.
