Here shall be a great big list of cars we want in the game! As listed, each vehicle should be either
be driven by an opposing driver or for sale in the newspaper. Do we want this list sorted by manufacturer,
year, or cost?


Maxaxle suggestions:
1: 1950s/1960s sedan that was considered sporty in its own day. Not fast, but stable in the corners.
2: 1960s/1970s economy car. Maybe a Falcon? Well-rounded, but not particularly good at any one thing.
3: Retired cop car with a decently large engine but weight and wear to offset it. Could win some
drag races with a fresher, bigger motor and beefier tires.
4: '70s compact or subcompact with something to prove, like a Gremlin. Great power-to-weight, and
featherweight handling, just not much actual power to start with.
5: A returning champion kind of car (like something that was amazing in SR1), but headed downhill
due to wear and slowly becoming obsolete. I'm actually not sure what general build this would
look like, but maybe its main strength is engine power, with handling a close second. 
6: I'd been joking at the time, but perhaps a Nash Metropolitan?


0rigin's suggestions:
2nd gen Buick skylark, plymouth duster, 4th gen Dodge Dart. All had slant 6 and larger v8 options
from factory. All had two door models, skylark and dart had four door options as well. I canâ€™t
imagine the slant six optioned models were all that fast

Hellmark:
1949-1950 Chevy Styleline Deluxe. Was a staple in SR1 as one of the starter cars.
1963 Studebaker Avanti. Something different, would be cheaper, but ahead of its time.
