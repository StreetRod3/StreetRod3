So, what atmosphere do we want for each location?

=== Garage ===
Lighting:
-Day lighting: Windows plus indoor fluorescent bulbs?
-Night lighting: Indoor fluorescent bulbs?
Audio:
-What background noises can be heard in the garage? Sounds from the street? Crickets at night?
-What does it sound like when you're working on a car in the garage? Is there echo off the
concrete floor, or do you just hear the sounds of your tools?
-If there's a radio in the garage, does it sound like it's sitting in a garage or does it
play audio directly to your ears?
Background/Foreground:
-Does the room itself feel worn-in or still fresh?
-Is the garage cluttered or mostly bare?
-Is the stuff in the garage orderly or sitting in piles and causing boxes to crumple?
-Are there amenities in the garage, or is it strictly tools?
-Is there unrelated stuff (paints, lawn equipment, workbench) or no?
Usable Items:
-What will be used to save the game? A clipboard, like in SR1 and SR2?
-Which tools will be used for each task? The type, wear, and quality of a given tool
can help to set the tone.
-If there's a radio in the garage, what does it look like? What songs are playing?

=== Cafe ===
Lighting:
-Day lighting: Sunlight! The cafe should have interior lighting, of course.
-Night lighting: Neon, all of it. Light should spill out from inside the cafe.
Audio:
-People outside chattering?
-Cars revving?
-Music from nearby car stereo?
Background/Foreground:
-What kind of cafe is this?
-What does this cafe feel like?
-How new or old is this cafe? How worn or fresh is it?
People:
-Who's here?
-What vehicles are parked/driving around?
-What are your opponents like?
Usable Items:
-How do you ask for a specific opponent?
-What else can you do at the cafe?

=== Gas Station ===
Lighting:
-Day lighting: Sunlight, with some lighting inside the station.
-Night lighting: Is there a roof over the pumps? If so, that's probably lit. The sign and 
station should definitely be lit.
Audio:
-Cars driving past?
-Gas pump noises?
Background/Foreground:
-What is this gas station like?
-What kind of gas pump are you using?
-How many pumps are there?
-Is anyone else getting gas?
People:
-Who else is here?
Usable Items:

=== Aqueduct ===
Lighting:
-Day lighting: Sunlight!
-Night lighting: Moonlight!
Audio:
-The sounds of the city, perhaps?
-Wind?
-Echoes from your own car?
Background/Foreground:
-Is it dirty and dingy here, or is it relatively clean?
-Is there litter or dumped trash?
-Are there cars abandoned here?
People:
-Is anyone else here?

=== Detroit ===
Lighting:
-What season is the game taking place in?
-Which areas are kept in shade by skyscrapers and taller buildings?
-Which areas are well-lit by street lights? Which areas aren't?
Audio:
-What do the different areas of the city sound like?
Areas:
-What areas will be depicted for tracks?
-What should each area feel like?
People:
-Traffic vehicles? Parked vehicles?
-Traffic behavior, if any?

=== The Car Interiors ===
It's 2022, we can quite easily make cars feel more tangible than was possible in the '90s.
Lighting:
-Not really applicable, but how good should car headlights be? This is as much an aesthetic
decision as it is a gameplay decision.
-Lights should fade on/off rather than switching on and off like LEDs can do.
Audio:
-A lot of things could have sounds associated with them. It really depends on what the player can do.
Usable Items:
-Should we have a radio in every car? I know that's a lot of work.
-Should the turn signals be usable?
-Should it even be possible to open the glovebox?
-What if the player could hang stuff from the mirror?
